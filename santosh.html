            <p>Themed pandals are the hallmark of Santosh Mitra Square. The Puja committee is known for taking inspiration from global monuments, heritage structures, and social messages.

One of the most iconic idols was created in 2018, where the goddess was adorned with 22-carat gold jewelry worth millions, making it a breathtaking sight.</p>

            <p>Along with visual splendor, the soundscape of the pandal is equally mesmerizing. Visitors are greeted by <strong>soothing chants, traditional drumming (dhak), and devotional songs</strong> that fill the air with an unmistakable festive vibe. The atmosphere is electric, with devotees offering prayers and participating in rituals, all while being surrounded by beautifully decorated lights and flowers.</p>

To manage the massive footfall, the organizers ensure smooth crowd management with dedicated entry and exit routes, and provide adequate security for the comfort of visitors.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the puja committee has also embraced <strong>technology</strong> by integrating LED light shows and 3D mapping onto the pandal structure, offering an immersive visual experience. These modern touches blend seamlessly with the traditional elements, creating a balance that appeals to all age groups. With a focus on delivering something unique each year, Santosh Mitra Square continues to captivate the hearts of millions.</p>
